# ðŸ“š Book Logger

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is one of my beginner Python projects â€” a simple book logger that lets you save and view the books you've read (or want to read).

### What it does:

- Lets you type in a book name
- Saves that name in a text file (`book.txt`)
- Gives you a way to see all your saved books

Pretty straightforward!

---

### How to use it:

1. Run the script (`logger.py`)
2. Youâ€™ll get a little menu:
   - Add a new book
   - View your saved books
   - Or exit
3. Your books are saved in a plain text file so you can check or edit them later.

### Why I built this:

Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and this project was a way to get used to:
- Taking user input
- Working with files
- Writing clean, simple logic

Itâ€™s not fancy (yet!), but it works.

### Whatâ€™s next?

This is just the beginning. I plan to:
- Make sure it doesnâ€™t save the same book twice
- Add a way to remove books
- Maybe put dates or categories
- And possibly make a nicer interface
